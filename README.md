Flashcard Learning App
This Flashcard Learning App is a basic command-line tool that uses flashcards to teach users new language. 
Users can input words and translations, and then participate in a learning session in which flashcards are presented in randomised order. 
The program improves language learning by allowing users to test their memory before viewing the translation.
